## **Unified AI AGENT**

## Overview
Unified AI AGENT is an innovative AI-powered application designed to provide seamless access to information from multiple sources, including:
- **Wikipedia**: For concise and detailed explanations.
- **arXiv**: For academic papers and research insights.
- **DuckDuckGo**: For broader web searches.

With an agentic AI architecture, the app delivers relevant, accurate, and contextual responses to your queries in real-time.

## Features
- **Multi-source Search**: Combines Wikipedia, arXiv, and web search for comprehensive results.
- **Conversational Interface**: Chatbot-style interaction for a user-friendly experience.
- **Dynamic Agent Behavior**: Powered by LangChain, enabling the AI to select the most suitable tool for your query.
- **Secure API Integration**: Supports secure input of Groq API keys for enhanced privacy.

## Technologies Used
- **Streamlit**: For building the user interface.
- **LangChain**: For orchestrating agentic AI and integrating search tools.
- **Groq API**: For leveraging advanced language models.
- **DuckDuckGo Search**: For general web searches.
- **arXiv API**: For retrieving academic research.
- **Wikipedia API**: For structured and detailed knowledge.
